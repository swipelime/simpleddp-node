### This is a re-implementation of DDPClient and meteor-sdk using corrected TypeScript and node only libraries.

Under the hood this is [DDPClient](https://github.com/Gregivy/simpleddp) and [meteor-sdk](https://www.npmjs.com/package/meteor-sdk) also [simpleddp-plugin-login](https://github.com/Gregivy/simpleddp-plugin-login) is integrated but those libraries are out of date and this was brought up to date with the latest typescript and tools. All browser related libraries were swapped out for the default node ones.

DDP (protocol) [specification](https://github.com/meteor/meteor/blob/devel/packages/ddp/DDP.md).

## Install

`npm install simpleddp-node --save`
